# Classification-of-Optical-Interconnection-Dataset
##  The main aim of the project is the classify the performance measures (variables) of the 2-Dimensional message passing architecture. The dataset is simulated using OPNET Modeler by passing 2-dimensional Data through the multiprocessor architecture. In this classification problem we use various types of machine learning models starting from the basic logistic regressions and tune the hyperparameters wherever needed like number of folds (K) in KNN, until we build the appropriate model which fits the model. The performance of the model is evaluated using Precision and Accuracy. The goal is to make the model as accurate as possible i.e., at least 90% and above.
